# 🌐 Multiple VPC Networks (GSP211)

## 🔎 Overview

Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks allow you to maintain **isolated environments** within a larger cloud architecture. This gives you **granular control** over network access, data protection, and application security.

In this lab, you will create multiple VPC networks and VM instances, then test connectivity between them. Two custom mode networks—**managementnet** and **privatenet**—will be created along with firewall rules and VMs, based on this architecture:

> **Note:** The **mynetwork** VPC, including firewall rules and two VM instances (*mynet-vm-1* and *mynet-vm-2*), is **already created** for you.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

You will learn how to:

- Create **custom mode** VPC networks with firewall rules  
- Create **Compute Engine VM instances**  
- Explore **network connectivity** across VPCs

...
```

---

### 📊 View VM Networking in Console

1. In the console:
Navigation menu → Compute Engine → VM instances

2. Click Column display options, then check Network → click OK.
There are now:
- 3 instances in Region_1
- 1 instance in Region_2

These instances are spread across three different networks:
managementnet, mynetwork, and privatenet, with no two VMs sharing both zone and network.

---

# 🌐 Task 3: Explore Connectivity Between VM Instances

In this task, you test how VM instances communicate using **external** and **internal** IP addresses, and observe how **VPC networks** affect connectivity.

---

## 🌍 Ping External IP Addresses

You will confirm whether VM instances are reachable from the public internet.

1. In the Cloud console, navigate to:  
   **Navigation menu → Compute Engine → VM instances**

2. Note the **external IPs** of:
   - **mynet-vm-2**
   - **managementnet-vm-1**
   - **privatenet-vm-1**

3. From the VM **mynet-vm-1**, click **SSH** to open a terminal.

---

### ✅ Test 1: Ping `mynet-vm-2`

```bash
ping -c 3 'Enter mynet-vm-2 external IP here'
```
✔️ This should work!


### ✅ Test 2: Ping managementnet-vm-1

```bash
ping -c 3 'Enter managementnet-vm-1 external IP here'
````
✔️ This should work!

### ✅ Test 3: Ping privatenet-vm-1

```bash
ping -c 3 'Enter privatenet-vm-1 external IP here'
```
✔️ This should work!

> 💡 Observation:
You can ping all external IPs regardless of zone or VPC network.
This is allowed because:
  - External IPs are public-facing.
  - You previously configured ICMP firewall rules that allow external pings.

---

### 🔒 Ping Internal IP Addresses

Now test internal communication between VM instances.
1. In the Cloud console, again note the internal IPs of:
  - mynet-vm-2
  - managementnet-vm-1
  - privatenet-vm-1

2. Return to the SSH session of mynet-vm-1.

---

### 🟢 Test 1: Ping internal IP of mynet-vm-2

```bash
ping -c 3 'Enter mynet-vm-2 internal IP here'
```
✔️ This should work!

> 💡 Even though the VM instances are in different zones, regions, or continents, they are in the same VPC network (mynetwork), so internal communication is allowed.

---

### 🔴 Test 2: Ping internal IP of managementnet-vm-1

```bash
ping -c 3 'Enter managementnet-vm-1 internal IP here'
```
❌ This should NOT work → Expect 100% packet loss

---

### 🔴 Test 3: Ping internal IP of privatenet-vm-1

```bash
ping -c 3 'Enter privatenet-vm-1 internal IP here'
```
❌ This should NOT work → Expect 100% packet loss

💡 Reason:
These VMs are in different VPC networks.
VPC networks are isolated private networking domains by default.
Internal communication is blocked unless you configure:
  - VPC Peering
  - VPN tunnels
  - Shared VPC

📌 Reminder:
For this task, consider:
- region_1 = Region_1
- region_2 = Region_2

---

## 🧪 Task 4: Create a VM Instance with Multiple Network Interfaces

Every instance in a VPC network has a default network interface. You can create additional network interfaces attached to your VMs. Multiple network interfaces enable you to create configurations where an instance connects directly to several VPC networks (up to 8 interfaces, depending on the instance type).

The CIDR ranges of the subnets must not overlap — this is required to attach multiple NICs.

---

### 🔍 Explore the Network Interface Details
🖥️ In the Cloud Console
Go to Compute Engine > VM Instances → click nic0 on vm-appliance.

✔️ Verify:

NIC 0
- Attached to privatesubnet-1
- Internal IP within 172.16.0.0/24
- Correct firewall rules

NIC 1
- Attached to managementsubnet-1
- Internal IP within 10.130.0.0/20

NIC 2
- Attached to mynetwork
- Internal IP within 10.128.0.0/20

> 📝 Each NIC gets its own internal IP so the VM can communicate with each network independently.

---

### 🖥️ In the VM Terminal

SSH into vm-appliance, then run:
```bash
sudo ifconfig
```

You should see three interfaces similar to:
```ini
