# 📝 Audit Logs in Google Cloud

Cloud Audit Logs provide visibility into **who did what, where, and when** in your Google Cloud environment. They are crucial for compliance, troubleshooting, and security monitoring.

## 📂 Types of Audit Logs

Google Cloud maintains **four audit logs** for each project, folder, and organization:

1. **Admin Activity Audit Logs** ✅
   - Log entries for API calls or administrative actions that **modify configuration or metadata** of resources.
   - Examples: creating VM instances, changing IAM permissions.
   - Always **enabled**, retained for **400 days**, and available at **no charge**.
   - Viewing requires IAM role: `Logging/Logs Viewer` or `Project/Viewer`.

2. **System Event Audit Logs** ⚙️
   - Log entries for **Google Cloud system actions** that modify resource configurations.
   - Not driven by user actions; generated automatically by Google systems.
   - Always **enabled**, free, and retained for **400 days**.
   - Viewing requires IAM role: `Logging/Logs Viewer` or `Project/Viewer`.

3. **Data Access Audit Logs** 🔐
   - Log API calls that **read configuration or metadata** of resources.
   - Includes **user-driven API calls** that create, modify, or read resource data.
   - **Excludes** publicly shared resources or resources accessible without logging in.
   - **Disabled by default** (except for BigQuery); default retention: **30 days**.
   - Viewing requires IAM roles: `Logging/Private Logs Viewer` or `Project/Owner`.

4. **Policy Denied Audit Logs** 🛑
   - Records when **access is denied** to a user or service account by Google Cloud service.
   - Generated by default; storage **charges apply**.
   - Cannot be disabled, but **exclusion filters** can prevent ingestion into Cloud Logging.
   - Useful for monitoring policy violations.
