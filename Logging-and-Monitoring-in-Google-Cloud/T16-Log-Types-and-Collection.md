# 📂 Log Types and Collection

Let's explore **Log Collection** and how it progresses to routing, storage, and visualization in Google Cloud Logging.

## 🔑 Key Log Categories

### 🌐 Platform Logs
Logs written by Google Cloud services.  
They help debug, troubleshoot, and understand your cloud services.

**Example:**  
- **VPC Flow Logs** — record a sample of network flows sent from and received by VM instances.

---

### 🧩 Component Logs
Generated by Google-provided software components running on your systems.  
**Example:**  
- **GKE components** running on your VM or data center generate logs sent to your Cloud project.  
- GKE uses these logs or metadata to provide support.

### 🔒 Security Logs
Answer the question: “Who did what, where, and when?”

**Examples:**
- **Cloud Audit Logs** — record administrative activities and accesses within your Google Cloud resources.  
- **Access Transparency** — logs actions taken by Google staff when accessing your Cloud content.

### 📝 User-Written Logs
Logs written by **custom applications and services**.  

**Common Methods to Write Logs:**
- **Ops Agent**  
- **Cloud Logging API**  
- **Cloud Logging Client Libraries**

---

### ☁️ Multi-Cloud & Hybrid-Cloud Logs
- Logs from **other cloud providers** (e.g., Microsoft Azure).  
- Logs from **on-premises infrastructure**.

**Sending Logs Programmatically:**
- Using client libraries  
- Using Logging agents  
- Using `gcloud logging write` or HTTP API `entries.write` for experimentation

## 🛠️ Agents and Log Collection

- **Container environments (GKE, Container-Optimized OS):**  
  Agents automatically collect logs from `stdout` and `stderr`.

- **Virtual Machines (VMs):**  
  Agents collect logs from known file locations or logging services:
  - Windows Event Log
  - journald
  - syslogd

- **Serverless Compute (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions):**  
  - Simple runtime logging is included by default.  
  - Logs written to `stdout` or `stderr` automatically appear in the Google Cloud Console.
