# ☁️ Overview of Cloud Computing

## 📌 Introduction

The **U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)** created the term *cloud computing*, although there is nothing U.S.-specific about it.

## 🔑 Five Key Traits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has **five equally important traits**:

1. **⚡ On-Demand Self-Service**  
   Customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service.  
   Through a web interface, users can access processing power, storage, and network resources **without human intervention**.

2. **🌐 Broad Network Access**  
   Customers get access to those resources **over the internet**, from anywhere with a connection.

3. **🗂️ Resource Pooling**  
   The cloud provider maintains a **large pool of shared resources** and allocates them dynamically.  
   This allows providers to **buy in bulk** and **pass savings to customers**.  
   Customers don't have to know or care about the exact physical location of those resources.

4. **📈 Rapid Elasticity**  
   The resources are **elastic**—meaning flexible.  
   Customers can scale resources up or down quickly, depending on their needs.

5. **💰 Measured Service (Pay-as-You-Go)**  
   Customers **pay only for what they use** (or reserve).  
   If they stop using resources, they stop paying.

> ✅ And that's it—that’s the definition of **cloud computing**.

## 🏛️ Evolution of Cloud Computing
But why is the cloud model so compelling nowadays?  
To understand why, we need to look at some history.

### 1️⃣ First Wave: Colocation  
The trend toward cloud computing began with **colocation**.  
- Users rented **physical space** instead of buying data center real estate.  
- This provided **financial efficiency**.

### 2️⃣ Second Wave: Virtualized Data Centers  
Modern **virtualized data centers** share similarities with older colocation facilities.  
- Components like servers, CPUs, disks, and load balancers became **virtual devices**.  
- Enterprises still maintained the infrastructure, keeping it **user-controlled and user-configured**.

### 3️⃣ Third Wave: Container-Based Cloud  
Google realized that virtualization wasn’t fast enough for its needs.  
- It moved to a **container-based architecture**, creating a **fully automated, elastic cloud**.  
- Services automatically **provision and configure infrastructure** used to run applications.

Today, **Google Cloud** offers this **third-wave cloud** to its customers.

## 🔮 The Future of Cloud Computing
Google believes that in the future:
- Every company, regardless of size or industry, will **differentiate itself through technology**.  
- Increasingly, that technology will take the form of **software**.  
- **Great software** depends on **high-quality data**.

> 💡 This means that every company is, or will eventually become, a **data company**.
