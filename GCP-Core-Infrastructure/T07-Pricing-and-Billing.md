# 💰 Google Cloud Pricing Overview

To wrap up this section, here’s a clear and concise look at **Google Cloud’s pricing structure** — designed to be flexible, efficient, and cost-friendly. 🌤️

---

## 🕒 Per-Second Billing  
Google was the **first major cloud provider** to introduce **per-second billing** for its IaaS compute service (Compute Engine).  

Per-second billing also applies to:  
- 🚢 **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**  
- 🗃️ **Dataproc** (Google’s managed Hadoop/Spark service)  
- 🌐 **App Engine Flexible Environment VMs**

This means you only pay for **exact usage**, not rounded-up time blocks.

---

## 💸 Sustained-Use Discounts (Automatic!)  
When you run a VM for a significant portion of the month, Google automatically applies a discount.

- After using a VM for **more than 25% of a month**, you begin receiving **incremental discounts for every additional minute**.  
- No need to pre-purchase or commit — the system handles it for you. 🎉

---

## 🛠️ Custom Machine Types  
Compute Engine allows you to **fine-tune vCPU and memory** to match your precise workload needs.  
This means:  
- No paying for unused capacity  
- Better performance-to-cost efficiency ⚙️

## 🧂 Avoiding Unexpected Bills  

### 📊 Budgets  
You can set budgets at:  
- The **billing account level**  
- The **project level**

Budgets can be:  
- A fixed monetary limit 💵  
- A percentage of last month’s spending 📈

### 🔔 Alerts  
You can get notifications when your spending reaches a percentage of your budget.  
Common alert levels are:  
- 50%  
- 90%  
- 100%  

📌 **Example:**  
If your budget is **$20,000** and you set a **90% alert**, you'll be notified at **$18,000** spent.

---

## 📉 Cost Reports  
The **Reports** tool in the Google Cloud Console helps you visually track spending by:  
- Project  
- Service  
- Time range  

A great way to monitor trends and detect anomalies. 👀

---

## 🛡️ Quotas — Built-in Protection  
Google Cloud uses quotas to prevent:  
- Accidental overuse  
- Billing spikes  
- Abuse or malicious consumption  

There are **two types of quotas**:

### 1️⃣ Rate Quotas  
- Limit the number of operations over time  
- Reset automatically  
- Example: GKE allows **3,000 API calls per project every 100 seconds**  

### 2️⃣ Allocation Quotas  
- Limit how many resources you can create  
- Example: Each project has a default quota of **15 VPC networks**

If you need more, you can request a quota increase through Google Cloud Support. 📤
