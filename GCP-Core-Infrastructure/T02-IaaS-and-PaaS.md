# ☁️ Cloud Service Models

The move to virtualized data centers introduced customers to **two new types of offerings**:  

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**

---

## ⚙️ Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS offerings provide **raw compute, storage, and network capabilities**, organized virtually into resources similar to physical data centers.  

- Example: **Compute Engine** (Google Cloud IaaS service)  
- **Billing model:** Customers pay for the resources they **allocate ahead of time**.

---

## 🖥️ Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS offerings **bind code to libraries** that provide access to the underlying infrastructure needed by applications.  

- This allows developers to focus more on **application logic** rather than infrastructure management.  
- Example: **App Engine** (Google Cloud PaaS service)  
- **Billing model:** Customers pay for the resources they **actually use**.

## 🔧 Managed Infrastructure & Services
As cloud computing has evolved, the momentum has shifted toward **managed infrastructure and managed services**.  

Benefits:  
- Companies can concentrate on **business goals** instead of maintaining technical infrastructure.  
- Products and services can be delivered **faster and more reliably**.

---

## 🛠️ Serverless Computing
Serverless computing is **another step in cloud evolution**.  

- Allows developers to focus on **code** rather than server configuration.  
- Eliminates the need for **infrastructure management**.  

Examples from Google Cloud:  
- **Cloud Run:** Deploy containerized microservices in a **fully-managed environment**.  
- **Cloud Run Functions:** Manage **event-driven code** as a **pay-as-you-go service**.

## 📦 Software as a Service (SaaS)
SaaS provides the **entire application stack** as a cloud-based service.  

- Applications run in the cloud and are **consumed directly over the internet** by end users.  
- No installation is required on local computers.  

Examples from Google Workspace:  
- **Gmail**  
- **Docs**  
- **Drive**  

> 💡 SaaS allows users to access full applications from anywhere without managing underlying infrastructure.
