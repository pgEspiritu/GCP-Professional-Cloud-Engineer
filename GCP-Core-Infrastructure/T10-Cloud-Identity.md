# 🆔 Cloud Identity

When new Google Cloud customers begin using the platform, they often log into the Google Cloud Console with a **Gmail account** and use **Google Groups** to collaborate with teammates in similar roles.  

While this approach is easy to start with, it introduces challenges later because the team’s identities are **not centrally managed**. ⚠️

For example, if someone leaves the organization, there’s **no simple way** to immediately remove that user’s access to cloud resources.

## 🛡️ What Cloud Identity Provides

With **Cloud Identity**, organizations can define policies and manage users and groups using the **Google Admin Console**.  

Admins can log in and manage Google Cloud resources using the **same usernames and passwords** they already use in existing **Active Directory** or **LDAP** systems. 🔐

## 👤 Handling Employee Departures

When someone leaves an organization:

- An administrator can disable their account through the **Google Admin Console**  
- They can also remove the user from relevant groups  
- Access to Google Cloud resources is removed immediately ✔️

This ensures centralized and secure identity management.

## 💼 Cloud Identity Editions

Cloud Identity is available in:

- **Free edition**  
- **Premium edition** – includes mobile device management capabilities 📱

If you're a **Google Workspace** customer, this functionality is already built into your **Google Admin Console**.
