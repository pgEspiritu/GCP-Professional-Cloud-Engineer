## 🔹 Cloud Trace Overview

- **Distributed tracing system** that collects latency data from applications  
- Visualizes traces in the **Google Cloud console**  
- Provides **near real-time performance insights**  

---

## 🔹 Key Capabilities

- Track how **requests propagate** through your application  
- Automatically analyze traces to generate **latency reports**  
- Identify **performance degradations** across your system  

---

## 🔹 Supported Sources

Cloud Trace can capture traces from:

- App Engine  
- Global external Application Load Balancers  
- Applications instrumented with the **Cloud Trace API**

---

## 🔹 Benefits

- Helps manage the time it takes for applications to handle incoming requests  
- Provides visibility into overall **application performance**  
- Based on the tools Google uses to **run services at extreme scale**
